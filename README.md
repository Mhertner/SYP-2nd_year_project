# ML Project
This project explores the possibility of using the elemental composition and refractive index to determine the origin of a very small glass fragment by using different ML models, some which are implemented with Scikit-learn while other are implemented by ourselves.

The code in this repository was made by Sofus Konglevoll, Morten Holck Ertner and Gustav Bakhauge.
The models we implemented ourselves can be found under src in the 'models' folder. The rest of the code can be found under src in the 'code' folder.
